# 2016-Live-Web-Archive
My projects from my Live Web Digital Ocean Droplet.

Each projects has a node_modules folder that contains the empty folders of the required modules (instead of a package.json file ;) Install the required dependencies and hope for the best. 

Also many of these require an ssh certificate. I deleted all of them to put on github.
